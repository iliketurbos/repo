    <description>Cydia HTTPatch is a tweak that makes Cydia request its pages over HTTP, improving the usability and speed drastically on iOS 3. It *should not* be installed on iOS 4 and above as they support Server Name Identification (SNI) over HTTPS, removing the need for this tweak - the tweak also gives every loaded webpage access to the cydia JavaScript object, posing a potential security risk. Use with caution.</description>
